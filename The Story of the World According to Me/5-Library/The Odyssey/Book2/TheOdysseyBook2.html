		<h3> Book II </h3> 
		<p>
		Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,
		girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in 
		assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in 
		hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as 
		he went by, and when he took his place' in his father's seat even the oldest councillors made way for him. 
		</p>
		<p>
		 Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, the first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius, land
		 of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him, He 
		 had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless their
		 father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still weeping for him when he began his speech. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Men of Ithaca," he said, "hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can 
		it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us,
		or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's 
		desire." 
		</p>
		<p>
		 Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the 
		 assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aegyptius, "Sir," said he, "it is I, as you will shortly learn,
		 who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, 
		 nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which
		 have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like a
		 father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief
		 men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him to choose 
		 the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing
		 our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can
		 stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all 
		 my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any 
		 longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the 
		 wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of
		 councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the 
		 Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house and home at
		 all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with notices 
		 from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy."
