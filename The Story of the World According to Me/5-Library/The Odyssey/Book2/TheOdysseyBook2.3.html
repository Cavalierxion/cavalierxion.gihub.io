		<h3> Book II </h3> 
		<p>
		Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, "Go home, old man, and prophesy to your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens
		myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has
		died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of 
		Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you- and it shall 
		surely be- when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his young 
		friend will only fare so much the worse- he will take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in the next, we will lay a heavier
		fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of
		you all to send his mother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may
		expect. Till we shall go on harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine speeches, nor for 
		any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and continue to eat 
		up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of
		expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we 
		should marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Then Telemachus said, "Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of 
		Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos
		in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some 
		heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for
		yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp,
		build a barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again." 
		</p>
		<p>
		With these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority
		over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus: 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; 
		I hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as
		though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,
		and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked
		at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for you are 
		many and they are few." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, "Mentor, what folly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard 
		thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his 
		house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would
		be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people 
		go about your business, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all- which
		I do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him something." 
		</p>
		<p>
		On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.
