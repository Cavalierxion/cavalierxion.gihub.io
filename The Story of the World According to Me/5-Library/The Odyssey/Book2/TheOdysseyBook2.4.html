		<h3> Book II </h3> 
		<p>
		Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Hear me," he cried, "you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing.
		I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so."  
		</p>
		<p>
		As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of Mentor. "Telemachus," said she, "if you are made
		of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work 
		half done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope 
		in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better;
		still, as you are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father's wise 
		discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they
		have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they 
		shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will
		find you a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions 
		ready for your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags,
		while I go round the town and beat up volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them
		for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the suitors 
		flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, 
		"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans
		will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew to boot- so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble father." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Antinous," answered Telemachus, "I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you 
		should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and 
		whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though,
		thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must be passenger not captain." 
		</p>
		<p>
		As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering at
		him tauntingly as they did so. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Telemachus," said one youngster, "means to be the death of us; I suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or 
		again from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?" 
		</p>
		<p>
		Another said, "Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we 
		should have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who 
		marries her have that."
