		<h3> Book I </h3>
		<p>
		Then Telemachus spoke, "Shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors, let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it 
		is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal
		notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in 
		spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man 
		to avenge you." 
		</p>
		<p>
		The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, "The gods 
		seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before you." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Telemachus answered, "Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of 
		for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in 
		Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those 
		whom Ulysses has won for me." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, "It rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own 
		house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want
		to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news about the
		return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a 
		moment before we could get to know him." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"My father is dead and gone," answered Telemachus, "and even if some rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed
		sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus,
		chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's." But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed 
		each in his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full
		of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had 
		bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his 
		household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. She it was who now 
		lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a
		baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it
		tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt
		home by means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage of
		the counsel that Minerva had given him.
