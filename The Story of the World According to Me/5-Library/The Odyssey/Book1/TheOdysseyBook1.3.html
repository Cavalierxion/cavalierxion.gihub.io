		<h3> Book I </h3>
		<p>
		"I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all 
		this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see my father
		come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an 
		ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell me 
		and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought
		you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are 
		you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much 
		himself." 
		</p>
		<p>
		And Minerva answered, "I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have
		come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back 
		copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. 
		Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now,
		and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from 
		pottering about his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him 
		back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who
		are detaining him against his will I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and 
		assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find some 
		means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed 
		wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went 
		also. Since that time we have never either of us seen the other." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"My mother," answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one 
		who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father." 
		</p>
		<p>
		And Minerva said, "There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, 
		what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the 
		family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over the 
		whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near them." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, so long as my father was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their 
		displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better 
		even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were 
		done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-winds 
		have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does
		the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our 
		islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under 
		the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so 
		they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself."
