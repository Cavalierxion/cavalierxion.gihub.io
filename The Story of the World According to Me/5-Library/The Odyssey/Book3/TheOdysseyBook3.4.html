		<h3> Book III </h3> 
		<p>
		"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people 
		in your house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise 
		you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to
		get back from, when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth,
		so vast and terrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your own men with you; or if you 
		would rather travel by land you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where
		Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person."  
		</p>
		<p>
		As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, "Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the 
		tongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go 
		to bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious festival."  
		</p>
		<p>
		Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages
		filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering; then they threw the
		tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings. When they had made their offerings and had drunk
		each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and 
		stayed them.   
		</p>
		<p>
		"Heaven and the immortal gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that you should leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am
		so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for 
		my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp 
		down on the deck of a ship- not while I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as have done."     
		</p>
		<p>
		Then Minerva answered, "Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, 
		therefore, shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and keep them in good 
		heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' own age, who have taken this voyage out
		of friendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians where I have a large 
		sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let one of
		your sons go with him. Be pleased also to provide him with your best and fleetest horses."  
		</p>
		<p>	
		When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, 
		and took Telemachus by the hand. "My friend," said he, "I see that you are going to be a great hero some day, since the gods 
		wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Jove's 
		redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed such favour towards your brave father among the Argives." "Holy queen," he
		continued, "vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in
		sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns,
		and will offer her up to you in sacrifice."  
		</p>
		<p>
		Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. 
		When they had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was 
		eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made 
		drink-offerings to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each
		as much as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room
		that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in 
		an inner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his side. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white 
		and polished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead,
		and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as 
		they left their rooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus,
		and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.
