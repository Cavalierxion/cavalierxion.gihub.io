		<p>	
		"My friend," said Nestor, "now that you remind me, I remember to have heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards 
		you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows 
		but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If
		Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so 
		openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would 
		soon some of them him, forget their wooing." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Telemachus answered, "I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even
		though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me."   
		</p>
		<p>
		On this Minerva said, "Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me,
		I should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than 
		get home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is
		certain, and when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond they are of him." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Mentor," answered Telemachus, "do not let us talk about it any more. There is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods 
		have long since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows
		much more than any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me,
		therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus
		to kill so far better a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus 
		took heart and killed Agamemnon?"  
		</p>
		<p>
		"I will tell you truly," answered Nestor, "and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from
		Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but 
		he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of 
		great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos,
		cajoled Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.    
		</p>
		<p>
		"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard 
		with her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven
		had counselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten 
		upon- after which she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated
		many temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.  
		</p>
		<p>	
		"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of
		Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a 
		vessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward,
		had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had 
		sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. 
		Here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus.
		There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as 
		far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus the coast is more protected, for a small 
		headland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to
		save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and 
		substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had 
		killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to 
		be his bane, and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a 
		banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his ships could carry.
