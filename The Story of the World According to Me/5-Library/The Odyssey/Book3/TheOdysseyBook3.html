		<h3> Book III </h3> 
		<p>
		But as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the 
		city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.
		There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and 
		burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune, Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship 
		to anchor, and went ashore. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said, "Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have taken
		this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he 
		has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"But how, Mentor," replied Telemachus, "dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long 
		conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who is so much older than myself." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Some things, Telemachus," answered Minerva, "will be suggested to you by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am 
		assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now." 
		</p>
		<p>
		She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were
		assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces 
		of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade 
		them take their places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were
		lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for 
		them into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the same time. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Offer a prayer, sir," said he, "to King Neptune, for it is his feast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your 
		drink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot 
		live without God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an age with myself, so I he handed I will give you the 
		precedence." 
		</p>
		<p>
		As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and proper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began 
		praying heartily to Neptune. "O thou," she cried, "that encirclest the earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon
		thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some 
		handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter
		that has brought us in our to Pylos."  
		</p>
		<p>
		When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were
		roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they 
		had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it will be best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and 
		from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's hand
		against you?"  
		</p>
		<p>
		Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself a good name.
