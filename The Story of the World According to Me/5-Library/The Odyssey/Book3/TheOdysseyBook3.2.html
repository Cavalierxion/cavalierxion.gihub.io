		<h3> Book III </h3> 
		
		<p>
		"Nestor," said he, "son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under 
		Neritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said 
		to have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but
		as regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he 
		perished, nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant
		at your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from 
		some other traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness 
		exactly what you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed 
		among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."  
		</p>
		<p>
		"My friend," answered Nestor, "you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while 
		privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles,
		Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we 
		suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though you were to stay here and question me for 
		five years, or even six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it
		ended. Nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no 
		one who could compare with your father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I can hardly believe my eyes- and you talk just like 
		him too- no one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any kind of difference from
		first to last neither in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might be ordered for
		the best. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex
		the Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either wise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through 
		the displeasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of Atreus.  
		</p>
		<p>
		"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they 
		explained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased 
		Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might 
		have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two 
		stood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what 
		they should do.  
		</p>
		<p>
		"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships 
		into the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest, about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the
		other half- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered 
		sacrifices to the gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second
		quarrel in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with 
		Agamemnon; but I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on 
		also with me, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our minds about our course- for we
		did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy 
		headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed
		our ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the 
		night to Geraestus, where we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed and his
		men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair
		for me.  
		</p>
		<p>
		"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who 
		were lost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that have reached me since I have been here in my own 
		house. They say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes.
		Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete. No matter
		how far out of the world you live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus- and a 
		fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes did,
		who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You too, then- for you are a tall, smart-looking fellow- show your 
		mettle and make yourself a name in story."   
		</p>
		<p>
		"Nestor son of Neleus," answered Telemachus, "honour to the Achaean name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through
		all time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked 
		suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father, so we 
		must bear it as best we may."
