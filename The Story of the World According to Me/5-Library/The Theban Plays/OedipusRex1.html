		<h3> Book I </h3>
		<p>
		[1] Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered full many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many were the 
		men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, aye, and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea, seeking to win his own life 
		and the return of his comrades. Yet even so he saved not his comrades, though he desired it sore, for through their own blind folly they 
		perished - fools, who devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion; but he took from them the day of their returning. Of these things, goddess, daughter 
		of Zeus, beginning where thou wilt, tell thou even unto us. 
		</p>
		<p>
		[11] Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer destruction, were at home, safe from both war and sea, but Odysseus alone, filled with 
		longing for his return and for his wife, did the queenly nymph Calypso, that bright goddess, keep back in her hollow caves, yearning that he
		should be her husband. But when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca, 
		not even there was he free from toils, even among his own folk. And all the gods pitied him save Poseidon; but he continued to rage unceasingly
		against godlike Odysseus until at length he reached his own land. Howbeit Poseidon had gone among the far-off Ethiopians -- the Ethiopians who 
		dwell sundered in twain, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises, there to receive a hecatomb of bulls and 
		rams, and there he was taking his joy, sitting at the feast; but the other gods were gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus.
		</p>
		<p>
		[28] Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak, for in his heart he thought of noble Aegisthus, whom far-famed Orestes, 
		Agamemnon's son, had slain. Thinking on him he spoke among the immortals, and said: <q>Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods.
		It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even of themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is 
		ordained. Even as now Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to himself the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and slew him on his 
		return, though well he knew of sheer destruction, seeing that we spake to him before, sending Hermes, the keen-sighted Argeiphontes, that
		he should neither slay the man nor woo his wife; for from Orestes shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when once he has come to manhood
		and longs for his own land. So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent he prevailed not upon the heart of Aegisthus; and now he has paid the
		full price of all.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
		[44] Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, aye, verily that man 
		lies low in a destruction that is his due; so, too, may any other also be destroyed who does such deeds. But my heart is torn for wise
		Odysseus, hapless man, who far from his friends has long been suffering woes in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea. 'Tis a wooded 
		isle, and therein dwells a goddess, daughter of Atlas of baneful mind, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself holds the tall pillars 
		which keep earth and heaven apart. His daughter it is that keeps back that wretched, sorrowing man; and ever with soft and wheedling words 
		she beguiles him that he may forget Ithaca. But Odysseus, in his longing to see were it but the smoke leaping up from his own land, yearns to 
		die. Yet thy heart doth not regard it, Olympian. Did not Odysseus beside the ships of the Argives offer thee sacrifice without stint in the 
		broad land of Troy? Wherefore then didst thou conceive such wrath against him, O Zeus? </q>
		</p>
		<p>
		[63] Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her and said: <q>My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth? How should I, then, 
		forget godlike Odysseus, who is beyond all mortals in wisdom, and beyond all has paid sacrifice to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven?
		Nay, it is Poseidon, the earth-enfolder, who is ever filled with stubborn wrath because of the Cyclops, whom Odysseus blinded of his eye -- 
		even the godlike Polyphemus, whose might is greatest among all the Cyclopes; and the nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys who rules 
		over the unresting sea; for in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon. From that time forth Poseidon, the earth-shaker, does not indeed slay 
		Odysseus, but makes him a wanderer from his native land. But come, let us who are here all take thought of his return, that he may come home;
		and Poseidon will let go his anger, for he will in no wise be able, against all the immortal gods and in their despite, to contend alone.</q> 
		</p>
		<p>
		[80] Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: <q>Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, if indeed this is now 
		well pleasing to the blessed gods, that the wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us send forth Hermes, the messenger, Argeiphontes, 
		to the isle Ogygia, that with all speed he may declare to the fair-tressed nymph our fixed resolve, even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast 
		heart, that he may come home. But, as for me, I will go to Ithaca, that I may the more arouse his son, and set courage in his heart to call to
		an assembly the long-haired Achaeans, and speak out his word to all the wooers, who are ever slaying his thronging sheep and his sleek kine of 
		shambling gait. And I will guide him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos, to seek tidings of the return of his dear father, if haply he may hear of it,
		that good report may be his among men.</q>
