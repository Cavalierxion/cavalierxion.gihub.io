		<h3> Book I </h3>
		<p>
		So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the 
		redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she
		darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor,
		Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which
		they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some 
		mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up 
		great quantities of meat. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would 
		send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, 
		he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her 
		right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. "Welcome," said he, "to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell 
		us what you have come for." 
		</p>
		<p>
		He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a strong
		bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a 
		cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might 
		not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father. 
		</p>
		<p>
		A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she 
		drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the 
		carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out
		for them. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went round
		with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. 
		As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant 
		brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low 
		to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man might hear.
