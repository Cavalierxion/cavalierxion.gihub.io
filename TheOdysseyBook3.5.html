		<h3> Book III </h3> 
		<p>
		"My sons," said he, "make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, 
		who manifested herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the
		stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus's ship, and invite all the
		crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the horns
		of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to 
		fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also- to bring me some clear spring water." 
		</p>
		<p>
		On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from
		the ship; the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the
		sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in 
		their beauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that had
		a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe,
		ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley
		meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer's head upon the fire. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke 
		that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable 
		wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted the heifer's head from off the 
		ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh
		bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then 
		Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in 
		their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put 
		the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil,
		she brought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of 
		Nestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were waited upon by some 
		worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and drink 
		Nestor said, "Sons, put Telemachus's horses to the chariot that he may start at once." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up
		a provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus
		gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open 
		country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till 
		the sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus
		and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning, 
		rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse. 
		Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the open country,
		and in the course of time completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,
