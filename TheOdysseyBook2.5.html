		<h3> Book II </h3> 
		
		<p>
		This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay 
		heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil,
		while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home 
		again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter of
		Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said: 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he 
		should escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some 
		well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing about it.
		I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see 
		if I can hear anything about the return of my dear father. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, "My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into
		your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who are the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some 
		foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the 
		way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying 
		your life out on the barren ocean." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Fear not, nurse," answered Telemachus, "my scheme is not without heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to
		my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil
		her beauty by crying." 
		</p>
		<p>
		The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and 
		getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the suitors. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at
		the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him to let her have a ship- which he was very ready to do. When 
		the sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally
		carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made 
		them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes 
		heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Telemachus," said she, "the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off." 
		</p>
		<p>
		On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side,
		and Telemachus said, "Now my men, help me to get the stores on board; they are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not 
		know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one." 
		</p>
		<p>
		With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,
		Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers
		and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from the West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon 
		Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross
		plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the 
		sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then
		they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from
		everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn.
