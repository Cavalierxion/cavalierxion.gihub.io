		"Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you do indeed want Ulysses home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if he is 
		the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were 
		he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son 
		of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If 
		Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you 
		to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your case before 
		them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set on 
		marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter
		may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your 
		father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message
		may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you 
		hear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If 
		on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and 
		make your mother marry again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these 
		suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes' praises for having 
		killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, 
		however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, 
		and remember what I have said to you." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Sir," answered Telemachus, "it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you 
		tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I
		will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as only
		dear friends give to one another." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Minerva answered, "Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till 
		I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return." 
		</p>
		<p>
		With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his 
		father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid 
		upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but 
		attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters 
		with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, 
		and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom
		I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos." 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Mother," answered Telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who
		makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated 
		return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only 
		man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily 
		duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter, and mine above all others- for it is I who 
		am master here." 
		</p>
		<p>
		She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she 
		mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and 
		prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.
