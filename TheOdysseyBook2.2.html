		<h3> Book II </h3> 
		<p>
		With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no 
		one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke thus: 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for
		she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of
		us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a 
		great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed 
		dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for I would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have 
		completed a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the
		place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' 
		</p>
		<p>
		"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick 
		the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was 
		now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had
		to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand-'Send 
		your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's choice'; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on 
		plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is so
		clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing to
		your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven 
		has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and
		glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she
		has made her choice and married some one or other of us." 
		</p>
		<p>
		 Telemachus answered, "Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not know 
		 whether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his
		 daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house 
		 will calf on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you 
		 choose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on 
		 the other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall
		 in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you." 
		</p>
		<p>
		As he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own 
		lordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and
		glaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right 
		over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best 
		prophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying: 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be 
		away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live 
		in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; 
		it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the 
		Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much hardship and losing all his men he should come home
		again in the twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true."
